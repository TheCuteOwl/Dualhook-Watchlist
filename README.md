## About

The "Dualhook Watchlist" repository is dedicated to tracking, monitoring, and documenting individuals or programs associated with the creation and use of "dualhooks." Dualhooks are a potential security concern in various online platforms, including Discord. These hooks may be used for unauthorized access and data theft.

Our mission is to maintain a comprehensive list of known dualhook creators, their pseudonyms (usernames), associated links or profiles, and relevant webhook information. By actively monitoring and sharing information about dualhook activities, we aim to enhance online security and protect communities from potential threats.
